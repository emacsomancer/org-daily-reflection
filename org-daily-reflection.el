;;; Commentary:
;; Reflect on your org(-roam) daily journal entries.  Shows a range of
;; split windows, each with an org(-roam) daily in them, at specified intervals.

;; You can use like one does with a paper three- or five-year diary,
;; to see what was happening on this day last year, and the year prior, etc.

;; But you could also look at the last six days of daily journals, or dailies
;; at other specified intervals (e.g., days, weeks, fortnights, months,
;; years, decades, centuries).

;;; Installation:
;; Available on MELPA: https://melpa.org/#/org-daily-reflection
;;
;; To install manually, clone the git repo somewhere and put it in your
;; load-path, e.g., add something like this to your init.el:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path
;;             "~/.emacs.d/org-daily-reflection/")
;;  (require 'org-daily-reflection)
;;
;; See README.org for more details and suggestions.

;;; Usage:
;; Interactive interface with the function `org-daily-reflection', which
;; can also be passed a span and range number directly in elisp
;; (e.g. 'year and 3, to get dailies comparing this day on
;; the last three years.) A few sample one-shot functions with prefix
;; `org-daily-reflection-on-last-' are included.

;;; Advice:
;; None currently.

;;; Code:

;;;; Dependency requires

(require 'org)

;; (require 'org-roam)

;; Note: this package doesn't actually require `org-roam', but it may have more
;; functionality if `org-roam' is enabled. However, it can also be used with
;; `org-node' and potentially other Zettelkasten/daily-note `org-mode' related
;; packages.

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib)) ;; for `cl-loop'

(require 'compat) ;; for `while-let' (at least)
